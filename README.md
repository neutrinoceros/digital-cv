### Post-doc (2020-2023) (current position)
I am currently employed as a contractual researcher at [IPAG](https://ipag.osug.fr),
where I am collaborating with Geoffroy Lesur on the development of the GPU-accelerated
Magneto-Hydrodynamics (MHD) simulation code
[Idefix](https://github.com/idefix-code/idefix) (`C++`).

### Ph.D in Astrophyics
> Doctorat en Sciences de la Terre et de L'Univers, *Université de Nice*, **2020**

My thesis was supervised by Héloïse Méheut and François Ménard.
I worked on hydrodynamics of planet-forming disks. Specifically, I studied the migration
of giant planets via planet-disk interactions, and I worked on connecting simulations to
observations in the context of dusty clumps formed by giant vortices.

I produced, developed, and analyzed hydrodynamics simulations with Fargo (`C`, then
`C++`) and MPI-AMRVAC (`Fortran90`). I used mcfost (`Fortran90`) to produce synthetic
observations of my models, using a glue code I developed in `Python` to automate the
conversion pipeline.

In addition to the features I needed for my own research, I contributed to all codes I
used with tests, automation, and bug fixes.

### Master's: Astronomy and Astrophysics
> Master d'Astronomie, Astrophysique et navigation spatiale, *Université Paris VII*, **2016**

### Bachelor's: Fundamental Physics
> Licence de Physique Fondamentale, *Université Paris VII*, **2014**
